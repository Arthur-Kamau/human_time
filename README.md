Flutter plugin to show difference in time that humans can easily understand.

    Calculates the time between the two provide timestamps and provides the human readable time

* `String timeFrom (DateTime from)`

add time diff based on time zone.

        * EAT -East Africa time
        * India Standard Time (IST)
